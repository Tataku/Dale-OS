# Financial Evidence Grade

## Rule

**An estimate is not an authority.**

## Workflow

1. Attach a provenance grade to each consequential input: OBSERVED, AUTHORITATIVE, USER_ATTESTED, DERIVED, ESTIMATED, RECONSTRUCTED, or UNKNOWN.
2. Record source id/date where available. Keep freshness separate from provenance.
3. Define allowed uses for the grade. Example: an estimate may inform research but may not silently alter tax basis.
4. Propagate the weakest material dependency into downstream readiness or caveats.
5. Never upgrade ESTIMATED to AUTHORITATIVE because deterministic math was applied afterward.
6. When a higher-grade source arrives, replace or supersede the lower-grade claim with an audit trail rather than erasing history.

## Falsify it

Try to identify the weakest evidence supporting each downstream use. If an estimate, reconstruction, or model inference is being used as accounting authority, fail the use even if the number looks plausible.

## Stop conditions

- A consequential write depends only on estimated/inferred evidence.
- Source provenance is missing for a value presented as authoritative.

A stop is an output, not an excuse. State what evidence or authority would unblock the work.

## Output

VALUE/CLAIM · GRADE · SOURCE/FRESHNESS · ALLOWED USES · DOWNSTREAM EFFECT · SUPERSESSION STATUS.

Keep the report short enough to act on. Preserve hard facts, unknowns, and blockers.
