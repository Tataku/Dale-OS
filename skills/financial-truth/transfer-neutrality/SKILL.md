# Transfer Neutrality

## Rule

**Money does not teleport.**

## Workflow

1. Identify candidate outbound and inbound legs using stable ids and explicit metadata before heuristics.
2. Confirm amount/asset, account pair, currency, and economically compatible dates.
3. When both sides are proven internal, set portfolio-level external flow and P&L effect to zero.
4. If only one leg exists, mark the transfer unpaired. Do not silently relabel it as an external withdrawal/contribution.
5. For asset transfers, preserve basis and holding period unless a governing tax/accounting rule says otherwise.
6. Report wrapper or jurisdiction changes separately; economic neutrality does not imply tax neutrality.

## Falsify it

Try to find the counterparty leg and prove conservation across the portfolio boundary. If one side is missing, do not force the event into contribution or withdrawal.

## Stop conditions

- Counterparty leg is missing and classification would alter performance.
- Transfer changes wrapper/jurisdiction and tax treatment is not established.

A stop is an output, not an excuse. State what evidence or authority would unblock the work.

## Output

TRANSFER PAIR · ACCOUNTS · AMOUNT/ASSET · EXTERNAL FLOW EFFECT · BASIS CONTINUITY · UNPAIRED/UNKNOWN STATE.

Keep the report short enough to act on. Preserve hard facts, unknowns, and blockers.
