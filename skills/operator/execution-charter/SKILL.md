name: execution-charter
description: Create a compact execution contract before non-trivial agent work. Use for coding, audit, refactor, migration, research, or operational tasks that need explicit objective, authority, scope, context budget, stop conditions, verification, and writeback before action.

# Execution Charter

## Rule

**Give the agent a fence before you give it a shovel.**

## Workflow

1. Classify the task by risk and breadth. Prefer the smallest class that fits the known work.
2. Extract authority from the user or governing task. Never infer a higher permission level from urgency or enthusiasm.
3. Write OBJECTIVE, AUTHORITY, SCOPE-IN, SCOPE-OUT, REQUIRED READS, VERIFY, STOP-IF, and WRITEBACK.
4. Keep context bounded. Broaden only when an explicit expansion trigger fires: protected boundary, authority conflict, unclear root cause, schema/state risk, data-loss risk, or evidence contradicting the charter.
5. If the charter expands, record the trigger and the newly added scope before continuing.
6. At completion, compare the actual diff/actions against the charter and report any expansion.

## Falsify it

Try to prove the charter is too broad: name a file, authority, or verification step that is not required for the objective. If you can, shrink it before work begins.

## Stop conditions

- Authority required for the next action is absent.
- The task crosses a protected or irreversible boundary not covered by the charter.
- The evidence contradicts the assumed root cause or scope.

A stop is an output, not an excuse. State what evidence or authority would unblock the work.

## Output

Return the charter first. At the end, return charter compliance: in-scope work, expansions, verification, blockers, and next state.

Keep the report short enough to act on. Preserve hard facts, unknowns, and blockers.
