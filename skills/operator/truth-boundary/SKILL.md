description: Enforce provenance and uncertainty boundaries. Use when a system mixes observed, authoritative, user-attested, derived, estimated, inferred, reconstructed, or unknown values; when missing data could become zero; or when downstream output may overstate certainty.

# Truth Boundary

## Rule

**Null is not failure. False certainty is.**

## Workflow

1. Identify the claim or value the system wants to use.
2. Name its provenance explicitly: observed, authoritative, user-attested, derived, estimated/inferred, reconstructed, or unknown.
3. Identify which downstream decisions or calculations consume it.
4. Prevent downstream layers from silently upgrading its authority.
5. Preserve unknown as unknown when evidence is insufficient. Do not coerce absence into zero, false, success, or reconciliation.
6. If a degraded output remains useful, label the degradation at the point of use.

## Falsify it

Try to trace every claimed value back to its evidence grade. If any downstream claim is more certain than its weakest required input, downgrade or withhold it.

## Stop conditions

- A consequential claim depends on unknown evidence and there is no sanctioned degraded mode.
- The only way to produce a value is to guess.

A stop is an output, not an excuse. State what evidence or authority would unblock the work.

## Output

CLAIM · PROVENANCE · ALLOWED USES · FORBIDDEN USES · DOWNSTREAM CONTAMINATION · VERDICT.

Keep the report short enough to act on. Preserve hard facts, unknowns, and blockers.
