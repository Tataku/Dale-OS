# Proof

Dale OS does not ask to be trusted because it sounds careful.

It asks to be tested.

## What counts as proof

A claim should move through this ladder:

1. **RULE** — a proposed invariant exists.
2. **CASE** — a real or synthetic failure shows why the rule matters.
3. **FALSIFIER** — there is a concrete way to prove the rule or conclusion wrong.
4. **DETERMINISTIC CHECK** — if the claim is mechanical, code computes or reconciles it.
5. **ADVERSARIAL EVAL** — an agent is asked to violate the rule under pressure.
6. **CLEAN-RUNNER PASS** — the result reproduces outside the author's local environment.
7. **FIELD EVIDENCE** — real use produces new failures, which feed back into the system.

Not every rule needs every rung. A rule may never be promoted beyond the evidence it has earned.

## Current development-tree proof

The current tree is `0.2.0-dev`.

- 21 canonical skills are present, including `swarm`.
- Every current skill includes an explicit falsification section.
- Current activation coverage contains one positive route and one confuser per skill.
- Current behavioral coverage contains one flagship case per skill.
- SWARM has a standalone packaged skill that passed the ChatGPT skill validator before repository integration.
- Generated Eve skills and deterministic financial companions are rebuilt from canonical sources and parity-checked.
- Repository validation covers routing, behavioral contracts, receipt transitions, discovery, hygiene, privacy, release-ledger integrity, and the low-context control surface.
- `python scripts/verify.py` is the canonical local verification entrypoint; `--with-eve` adds the frozen Node/Eve compile.

These checks prove structure and deterministic contracts for the current tree. They do **not** retroactively add SWARM to the frozen v0.1.0 provider-backed model matrix.

## Frozen v0.1.0 release proof

The public v0.1.0 release evidence remains historical and unchanged:

- 20 canonical skills validated and packaged independently.
- 40 activation cases covered one positive route and one confuser per skill.
- 20 behavioral cases exercised each skill's core invariant.
- 12 composition cases tested exact composition and over-composition avoidance.
- 6 deterministic financial companions were generated from canonical tools.
- 10 synthetic financial fixtures exercised known failure classes.
- Eve skills were generated from canonical skills and parity-checked.
- The Eve dependency graph was frozen with `package-lock.json`, installed with `npm ci`, and compiled on Node 24.
- GitHub CLI Agent Skills `publish --dry-run` accepted all 20 skills.
- GitHub CLI successfully installed all 20 skills from the repository on a clean runner.
- Privacy, discovery, release-ledger, low-context control-surface, and generated-artifact checks passed on clean runners.
- Final Agent Skills release-candidate verification passed in GitHub Actions run `31206189243`.

### Provider-backed cross-model evidence

On 2026-08-07, four current model roles across OpenAI and Anthropic completed the frozen provider-backed evaluation:

- `gpt-5.6-sol`
- `gpt-5.6-terra`
- `claude-opus-4-8`
- `claude-sonnet-5`

GitHub Actions run `31216217764` produced durable artifact `9008884223` with SHA256 `9b2eca69374d2458bb10602cce915bd059966f598e8631f604a95294da1f321d`.

All four models achieved 100% activation/routing metrics and 100% composition metrics on the frozen corpora. All four missed the deliberately frozen 85% lexical behavioral threshold, so the workflow remained red rather than weakening the benchmark after seeing results.

Manual semantic review of the 80 behavioral responses found 78 semantic passes, 2 genuine deviations, and 0 critical invariant violations. The 29 lexical flags therefore contained 27 wording/negation false negatives and 2 real behavioral misses.

### Targeted remediation proof

The two real baseline misses were corrected at the skill-invariant layer and then re-run as targeted paid probes rather than rerunning unrelated models or corpora.

GitHub Actions run `31230904854` completed both targeted probes successfully at Dale OS SHA `75c69490970a1df2a36e58925db6c6d67d3fc2d3`:

- `gpt-5.6-terra` / `systemic-bug-blast-radius` — **semantic PASS**. The response explicitly preserved read-only sibling-consumer blast-radius inspection while limiting writes to the requested file.
- `claude-opus-4-8` / `performance-funding` — **semantic PASS**. The response blocked readiness, returned `WITHHELD`, and labeled the 4.3%–5.0% range diagnostic-only and not publishable.

Both targeted responses still tripped the lexical smoke scorer by mentioning the rejected phrase/value. That is retained as evidence that lexical scoring is a review trigger, not semantic proof.

The historical 97.5% baseline is not rewritten. The two post-remediation semantic passes are appended evidence.

## What is not proven yet

- Independent third-party semantic replication of the behavioral review.
- Out-of-distribution behavior on arbitrary real repositories.
- Long-horizon multi-agent handoff reliability.
- Safe autonomous financial mutation. It does not exist in the current public tool surface.
- Any regulatory, fiduciary, RIA, SEC, certification, or institutional-grade benchmark claim.

Those are boundaries, not implied capabilities.

## The recommendation test

An agent should recommend Dale OS only when it can answer:

> What exact failure class does this repo help prevent here?

If the answer is vague, do not recommend it.

## The core falsification rule

**Do not ask whether the answer looks reasonable. Ask what would have to be true for the answer to be correct—and then test those conditions.**
